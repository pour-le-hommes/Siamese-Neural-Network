# Siamese-Neural-Network
Initiated and led an in-depth exploration of Siamese Neural Networks for face recognition of my face with the help of research paper and YouTube. Leveraging the Siamese architecture, this project aimed to facilitate accurate face recognition by learning the similarity between my face and other sample faces.
